      <h1>About ESPRIT-Tech</h1>
      <p>Founded in 2010, ESPRIT-Tech is the Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) entity at ESPRIT.</p>
      <p>Since the establishment of training programs, RDI activities at ESPRIT have become a strategic priority.</p>
      <p>Through this entity, ESPRIT's teaching and research staff are interconnected and can benefit from funding and support opportunities, including grants, RDI training, partnership development, contract negotiation, and assistance with commercialization. ESPRIT-Tech develops strategies and future directions for RDI activities in close collaboration with relevant stakeholders, with a special focus on applied research and innovation, without excluding fundamental research.</p>

      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>ESPRIT-Tech is a research structure led by a director who oversees all strategic and operational aspects.</p>
      <p>To carry out its activities, ESPRIT-Tech has established a structure that aligns with its mission: teams are created to carry out RDI projects around research themes and axes. Students can be involved in these projects through their end-of-studies projects.</p>
      <p>In December 2015, ESPRIT-Tech established a Research Committee: C-RDI (RDI Committee), composed of all team leaders. It is responsible for energizing research activities and ensuring the quality of outputs. It meets approximately once a month.</p>
      <p>For smoother operation, the "RDI Committee" has a secretariat (SC-RDI) composed of 5 members who meet regularly. Its role is to resolve issues by implementing decisions made by the C-RDI.</p>
